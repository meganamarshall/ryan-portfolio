    paragraph: 'Whoever thought prog and punk would be so suited for each other? Certainly the possibility of a compromise occurred to Robert Fripp (look no further than Red-era King Crimson for an example of early prog-punk-rock, which was one of his better ideas). Ryan Miller, guitarist in the Portland-based progressive, experimental, post-whatever band U Sco, has also combined the two almost contradictory styles with ambiguous and riveting results. It\'s essentially aggressive progressive rock, but stripped of (most) of the unpleasant excesses and regurgitated medieval allusions associated with the genre.

    paragraph: 'Ryan Miller’s interpretation of the guitar fretboard is boundless and exhilarating, and drummer Phil Cleary commands the kit with both restraint and frenzy. Treffpunkt teeters on the edge of chaos, tip-toeing on the brink of abstraction, while keeping rooted in its composition. Their creativity is tireless and the tracks pass too quickly, a difficult feat considering their intricacies. While every song on Treffpunkt is unique, they blend into the same style, which makes it difficult to single out a favorite, although “Iguana House” is notably scathing.
